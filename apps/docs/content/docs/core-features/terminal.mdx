# Core Features - Terminal

OpenCode Portal now includes comprehensive terminal support, bringing a full development environment directly to your web browser.

## How Terminal Support Works

Portal implements terminal functionality through a sophisticated Docker-based architecture:

### Architecture Overview

1. **Project Directory Mounting**: Your project directory is mounted directly into the OpenCode Docker container, ensuring complete isolation while maintaining access to your files.

2. **Docker Socket Connection**: The container's Docker socket is exposed and connected to xtermjs React component in the web UI, creating a seamless bridge between the browser and the containerized environment.

3. **Web-based Terminal**: Using xtermjs (a terminal emulator written in JavaScript), Portal provides a fully functional terminal interface that runs entirely in your web browser.

### Technical Implementation

```
Browser (xtermjs) ↔ WebSocket ↔ Portal Web UI ↔ Docker Socket ↔ OpenCode Container
```

This architecture provides:

- **Real-time terminal interaction** through WebSocket connections
- **Full terminal emulation** with support for colors, cursor movement, and special keys
- **Isolated execution environment** while maintaining project file access
- **Cross-platform compatibility** - works on any device with a web browser

## Terminal Features

- **Full Terminal Emulation**: Complete xterm.js integration with support for ANSI escape codes
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based terminal sessions for instant command execution
- **Docker Integration**: Direct access to the OpenCode container through Docker socket mounting
- **Project File Access**: Your entire project is available within the terminal session
- **Session Persistence**: Terminal sessions remain active as long as the Portal container is running
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive terminal interface that works on mobile devices

## Usage

Once connected to your Portal instance, simply navigate to the terminal section and you'll have immediate access to a full development environment with:

- Standard Unix commands and utilities
- Access to your project's files and directories
- Ability to run scripts, build tools, and development servers
- Package manager access for installing dependencies
- Git integration for version control operations

## Best Practices

- Use standard development workflows within the terminal
- Leverage the isolated environment for safe testing and experimentation
- Take advantage of the web-based access for remote development scenarios
