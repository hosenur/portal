# Git Integration

Portal leverages OpenCode's powerful Git integration to provide seamless version control for your projects.

## Features

Portal supports all Git operations through OpenCode:

- **Commit changes**: Stage and commit files with meaningful messages
- **Branch management**: Create, switch, and merge branches
- **Push/Pull**: Sync with remote repositories
- **Diff viewing**: Review changes before committing
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle merge conflicts

## How It Works

OpenCode automatically detects Git repositories and provides Git-aware features:

1. **Repository Detection**: OpenCode identifies if your project is a Git repository
2. **Status Tracking**: Track modified, staged, and untracked files
3. **Commit History**: View and navigate commit history

## Using Git in Portal

Git operations are performed through the chat interface. Simply ask OpenCode to:

```
"Commit my changes with message 'Add new feature'"
"Create a new branch called feature/auth"
"Push to origin"
"Show me the diff of my changes"
```

## Git Configuration

For Git operations to work properly, ensure your Git configuration is set up:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

## SSH Keys

For pushing to remote repositories, make sure your SSH keys are configured:

```bash
# Generate SSH key if needed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"

# Add to ssh-agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Add the public key to your GitHub/GitLab account.
