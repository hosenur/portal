---

# Remote Setup

Access Portal from anywhere by running it on a VPS or home server with Tailscale.

## Architecture

```
[Your Phone/Laptop] ---(Tailscale VPN)---> [VPS running Portal + OpenCode]
```

This setup allows you to:

- Code from your phone or tablet
- Access your development environment from anywhere
- Keep your projects running on a powerful server

## Prerequisites

On your remote server:

1. **OpenCode** installed
2. **Node.js 18+** installed
3. **Tailscale** installed and connected

## Server Setup

### 1. Install OpenCode

```bash
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash
```

### 2. Install Portal globally

```bash
npm install -g openportal
```

### 3. Install and configure Tailscale

```bash
# Install Tailscale
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Start Tailscale and authenticate
sudo tailscale up
```

### 4. Run Portal

Navigate to your project and start Portal:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
openportal --no-browser
```

Note the `--no-browser` flag since there's no GUI on the server.

## Client Access

### 1. Install Tailscale on your device

Download Tailscale for your device:

- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1470499037)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn)
- [macOS/Windows/Linux](https://tailscale.com/download)

### 2. Connect to your server

Once connected to Tailscale, access Portal at:

```
http://[your-server-tailscale-ip]:3000
```

Find your server's Tailscale IP with:

```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

## Running as a Service

To keep Portal running after you disconnect, use a process manager like PM2:

```bash
# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Start Portal with PM2
cd /path/to/your/project
pm2 start openportal --name portal -- --no-browser

# Save the process list
pm2 save

# Setup startup script
pm2 startup
```

### Managing the service

```bash
# Check status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs portal

# Restart
pm2 restart portal

# Stop
pm2 stop portal
```

## Security Considerations

- Tailscale provides end-to-end encryption
- Portal is only accessible via your Tailscale network
- No ports need to be exposed to the public internet
- Consider using Tailscale ACLs for additional access control
