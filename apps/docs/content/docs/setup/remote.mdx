# Remote Setup

Access Portal from anywhere by running it on a VPS or home server with Tailscale.

## Architecture

```
[Your Phone/Laptop] ---(Tailscale VPN)---> [VPS running Portal + OpenCode]
```

This setup allows you to:

- Code from your phone or tablet
- Access your development environment from anywhere
- Keep your projects running on a powerful server

## Prerequisites

On your remote server:

1. **OpenCode** installed
2. **Bun** installed (recommended)
3. **Tailscale** installed and connected

> **Note**: OpenPortal works best when paired with Bun. Node.js may have some rough edges.

## Server Setup

### 1. Install Bun

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Install OpenCode

```bash
# Using curl (macOS/Linux)
curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash

# Or using bun
bun install -g opencode
```

### 3. Install Portal globally

```bash
bun install -g openportal
```

### 4. Install and configure Tailscale

```bash
# Install Tailscale
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Start Tailscale and authenticate
sudo tailscale up
```

Follow the authentication link that appears to connect your server to your Tailnet.

### 5. Run Portal

Navigate to your project and start Portal:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
openportal
```

Portal will display the URLs where you can access it.

## Client Access

### 1. Install Tailscale on your device

Download Tailscale for your device:

- [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/tailscale/id1470499037)
- [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn)
- [macOS/Windows/Linux](https://tailscale.com/download)

### 2. Connect to your Tailnet

Open Tailscale and sign in with the same account you used on your server.

### 3. Access Portal

Once connected, you can access Portal using any of these methods:

#### Using Tailscale IP

Find your server's Tailscale IP:

```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

Then access Portal at:

```
http://100.x.x.x:3000
```

#### Using MagicDNS (Recommended)

Tailscale's MagicDNS lets you access devices by hostname. If your server is named `myserver`, access Portal at:

```
http://myserver:3000
```

To check or set your machine name:

```bash
# Check current hostname
tailscale status

# Set a custom hostname
sudo tailscale set --hostname=myserver
```

#### Using Tailnet Domain

For a fully qualified domain name, use your Tailnet name:

```
http://myserver.tailnet-name.ts.net:3000
```

Find your Tailnet name in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) under DNS settings.

## Running as a Service

To keep Portal running after you disconnect, use a process manager like PM2:

```bash
# Install PM2
bun install -g pm2

# Start Portal with PM2
cd /path/to/your/project
pm2 start openportal --name portal

# Save the process list
pm2 save

# Setup startup script
pm2 startup
```

### Managing the service

```bash
# Check status
pm2 status

# View logs
pm2 logs portal

# Restart
pm2 restart portal

# Stop
pm2 stop portal
```

## Managing Multiple Projects

Portal supports multiple instances. Use the `--name` flag to identify each:

```bash
# Start Portal for different projects
cd /project-a && openportal --name project-a --port 3001
cd /project-b && openportal --name project-b --port 3002

# List all running instances
openportal list

# Stop a specific instance
openportal stop --name project-a
```

Access each project via MagicDNS:

```
http://myserver:3001  # project-a
http://myserver:3002  # project-b
```

## Security Considerations

- Tailscale provides end-to-end encryption
- Portal is only accessible via your Tailscale network
- No ports need to be exposed to the public internet
- Consider using [Tailscale ACLs](https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls) for additional access control
