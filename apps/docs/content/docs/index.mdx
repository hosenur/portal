Portal is a comprehensive mobile-first web UI for OpenCode. Use it on your home network or deploy to the cloud and access via VPN or Tailscale.

## Why Portal?

OpenCode itself is the best coding harness I've used - it's incredibly flexible and powerful. However, the web UI still lacks in places and isn't fully responsive. I built Portal to solve these issues, providing a complete mobile-first solution with everything included, eliminating configuration complexity so you can focus on development.

## How Portal Works

Portal is distributed as an npm package (`openportal`) that:

1. **Starts OpenCode Server**: Automatically launches the OpenCode server in your project directory
2. **Serves the Web UI**: Provides a beautiful, responsive web interface
3. **Opens Your Browser**: Automatically opens the Portal in your default browser

The entire setup takes just one command - no configuration needed.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Run Portal
npx openportal
```

That's it! Portal will start on `http://localhost:3000`.
