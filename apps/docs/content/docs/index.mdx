Portal is a comprehensive mobile-first web UI for OpenCode. Use it on your home network or deploy to the cloud and access via VPN or TailScale.

## Why Portal?

OpenCode itself is the best coding harness I've used - it's incredibly flexible and powerful. However, the web UI still lacks in places and isn't fully responsive. I built Portal to solve these issues, providing a complete mobile-first solution with everything included, eliminating configuration complexity so you can focus on development.

## How Portal Works

Portal runs two Docker containers to provide an isolated development environment:

1. **Portal Web UI**: The main web interface that you interact with
2. **OpenCode Container**: An isolated environment where your project runs

The project directory is mounted to the OpenCode container, ensuring complete isolation from your host system. The Portal web UI connects to this OpenCode container and provides you with a comprehensive UI to run commands on your project, manage files, and interact with your development environment seamlessly.
